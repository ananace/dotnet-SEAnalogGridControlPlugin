Analog Grid Control Plugin
==========================

**Nota Bene**; Still under active development.

This plugin allows for true analog control for grids in Space Engineers

Analog inputs are injected into the regular input pipeline, applying on top of any KB+M inputs.  
Should theoretically work seamlessly with the recorder as well as multiplayer.
